PABLO CORAL,
AI PROJECT FINAL REPORT - self code using autokeras and Codex

- Utilized Autokeras to run an ML model to predict sea turtle species
- "Cammy" bot was unable to recognize image URLs, which is why it was not used.

MUST follow the following folder struct to run:

PYTRAINER [root]
-> images [all included in latest push] (folder)
-> venv [must include all imports shown in *.py, esp. autokeras, tensorflow and numpy] (folder)
-> currentpredictor.py [use to predict single image once trainer has been ran and model is stored] (file)
-> maintrainer.py [use before running currentpredictor, to create .keras model] (file)
-> labels.csv [labeled data] (file)

@ latest commit 11/17 fixed software bloat issues from Codex agent.
